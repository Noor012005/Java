# Java Learning Repository ☕  

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repo**! 🚀  

This repository contains my journey of learning **Java programming**.  
It has a mix of:  
- ✨ Beginner-level practice programs (basic concepts, syntax, problem-solving)  
- 🛠️ Small projects to apply what I’ve learned  
- 📚 Notes and experiments while exploring Java  

## Purpose 🎯  
I created this repo to:  
- Track my learning progress in Java  
- Practice and improve problem-solving skills  
- Build a foundation for bigger projects in the future  

## Contents 📂  
- `Basics/` → Beginner-friendly code (loops, conditionals, arrays, OOP, etc.)  
- `Projects/` → Mini projects for hands-on learning  
- `Experiments/` → Random code snippets & practice exercises  

## Note 📝  
This repo is mostly **for learning purposes** — so you might find a mix of clean code, experiments, and work-in-progress files.  

## Contributions 🤝  
If you spot something I can improve or want to suggest better approaches, feel free to open an issue or pull request!
